Learning Diary: Journey Through the Digital World  

Welcome! My name is Denis Durban and I’m from Germany. My journey in IT began with a personal interest in programming, which quickly grew into a deep passion for technology. I explored various programming languages and ventured into different IT fields, but cybersecurity truly captivated me. In October 2024, I’ll have the opportunity to start my first IT job while also beginning my Cybersecurity studies at IU University. This blog serves as my personal diary, where I share my progress, challenges I encounter, various IT projects I work on in my free time, and interesting IT articles I come across. 
Everyone is welcome to join me on this journey.
