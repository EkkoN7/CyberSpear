Learning Diary: Journey Through the Digital World

Welcome! My name is Denis Durban, and I’m from Germany. My journey in IT began with a personal interest in programming, which quickly evolved into a deep passion for technology. I’ve explored various programming languages and delved into different IT fields, but cybersecurity has truly captivated me.

In October 2024, I’ll be starting my first IT job and beginning my Cybersecurity studies at IU University. This blog serves as my personal diary where I share my progress, the challenges I encounter, various IT projects I work on in my free time, and interesting IT articles I come across.

Everyone is welcome to join me on this journey!
