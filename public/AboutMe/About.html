<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello! I'm <a href="./CV.html">Denis Durban</a>, a 35-year-old from Germany. By day, I'm a dedicated kindergarten teacher. But when the sun sets, my true passion comes alive: Cybersecurity.</p>

<p> About a year ago, I stumbled upon programming, and it was like discovering a hidden treasure. 
    I tinkered with various languages, frameworks, and tools, exploring the vast digital landscape. 
    But amidst the code and algorithms, I found my calling—the thrilling world of cybersecurity.
    Now, I'm on a mission to turn this passion into a profession. 
    I devour knowledge, diving into the foundations of network security, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessment. 
    My sights are set on the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) exam—a challenging yet exhilarating journey that will test my skills to the limit.
    In the meantime, I wear my bug bounty hunter hat. Part-time, of course! I scour the web, seeking vulnerabilities, loopholes, and misconfigurations. 
    Every discovered flaw is a victory—a step closer to mastering the art of securing digital realms.</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome to join me on this wild ride through firewalls, cryptic codes, and virtual battlegrounds. Welcome aboard, and let's get started!</p>
