<p> Hello everybody! Ethical hacking is a vast field, and during my last job interview, they asked if I specialized in any topic.
    From the very beginning, I was drawn to bug bounty hunting, so choosing to specialize as a Web Application Security Pentester was an easy decision for me. 
    Deciding between Python and JS wasn't straightforward; both have their pros and cons, and I'll likely need to know both in the future. 
    However, for now, I feel that JS is the better choice, especially considering how many HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes I've recently delved into. 
    While I haven't mastered any programming language yet, I have a solid foundation, and I hope this journey will be smooth. 
    My plan is to keep practicing JavaScript to become really proficient.</p>
