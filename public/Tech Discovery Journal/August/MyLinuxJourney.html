      <h1 class = montserrat-h1>My Linux Journey</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
        This week I hardly posted anything, that's because I decided last weekend to try and find 
        the most suitable Linux distro for me. My goal was to find a Linux distro that is 
        lightweight, fast, good for coding, able to run VirtualBox and Steam smoothly.
        I didn't take any screenshots because the idea for this section of the blog came to me 
        too late.<br />
        Initially, I got blinded by the desire to try an Arch Linux distro, so I downloaded 
        <a href="https://garudalinux.org/" target="_blank">Garuda Linux</a>.
        I really liked that it instantly installed all the newest drivers for my 
        Nvidia graphics card. The Btrfs graphical interface was also very good and easy to use. 
        However, after some experimentation, I decided to explore other options.
        I tried <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora 40</a>, while GNOME looks modern, it feels a bit stiff to me. Additionally, I 
        encountered a security problem that I couldn't fix, even after reinstalling the kernel.
        The latest <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/upgrade-your-desktop-ubuntu-24-04-lts" target="_blank">Ubuntu LTS</a> felt bloated to me – it offers a lot of stuff, but I just can't 
        get into it.       
        <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank">Manjaro</a> and <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">OpenSUSE</a> didn't amaze me either; they're not bad, but I use my computer a 
        lot in my free time. There are so many distros out there, so why should I use one that 
        doesn't satisfy my needs?
        I also tried <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop OS</a>, which worked pretty well, but I couldn't connect with it because 
        it's Ubuntu-based. Yes, I know – I've developed a slight dislike for Ubuntu.
        In the end, I returned to <a href="https://www.parrotsec.org/" target="_blank">Parrot OS</a>, which has been my go-to distro in the past. It runs 
        smoothly on my computer and meets all my requirements. CachyOS was another great option 
        I explored; it's fast, KDE Plasma looks amazing, and it's Arch-based, so my computer 
        would always be up to date with the newest versions.
        Newest tech also means more problems could arise, and using an Arch Linux distro 
        requires users not to be too lazy to read many wikis to stay informed. Ultimately, I'm 
        happy with my decision to stick with Parrot OS, which suits me perfectly.<br />
        This week, I learned a lot about different distros and how to save versions using Btrfs 
        or Timeshift. I want to end this post by saying that I'm still learning about Linux – 
        it's a complex system, and there's always something new to discover. However, with 
        patience and practice, anyone can become proficient in using Linux.
